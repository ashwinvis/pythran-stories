Unfortunately, I ended up with a code roughly two times slower than the Cython version. That's still good with respect to the Python version, but a bit disapointing.\n",

So I was not comparing the same computations. In a similar manner the Pythran version -- just like the Python version -- uses double precision floating pointer numbers, whereas Cython version is specialized to use single precision number.\n",

    "This alone should not explain the difference between the two implementations, but it turns out it does, because one of the hotspot of the program is the modulo computation in the  loop indexing (modulo is a relatively costly operation compared to an add, and even a branch mis predicttion, check this [great table](http://ithare.com/infographics-operation-costs-in-cpu-clock-cycles/) for some reminder about that), and its cost increases with the integer size).\n",

    "``i`` and ``j`` being loop induction variables is relatively simple, Pythran already provides the [tooling for identifier binding](http://serge-sans-paille.github.io/pythran-stories/identifier-binding-computation.html), so binding the identifier ``range`` to the according builtin is not an issue, and walking the [use-def chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use-define_chain) is also within the scope of Pythran analyses.\n",
