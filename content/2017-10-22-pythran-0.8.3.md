Title: Pythran 0.8.3 is out!
Date: 2017-10-22
Category: release
Lang: en
Authors: serge-sans-paille
Summary: Pythran version bump, new PyPI packages + Conda release, and a Changelog commented in a Jupyter notebook.

This blogpost originally was a Jupyter Notebook. You can [download it](notebooks/pythran - 0.8.3.ipynb) if you want. The conversion was done using ``nbconvert`` and a [custom template](notebooks/nbmarkdown.tpl) to match the style of the other part of the blog.


# Pythran minor version bump

So Pythran just got a version bump. The primary goal of this version is to match the upgrade of the ``networkx`` dependency. Pythran now requires ``networkx>=2.0``.


```python
>>> import pythran
```


```python
>>> pythran.__version__
```




    '0.8.3'



A few extra stuff are bundled in this new version, let's explore them using this notebook.

# Fix Jupyter magic

Pythran comes with a Jupyter magic cell extension, very similar to Cython's, that makes it possible to compile Python code with Pythran within a cell.


```python
>>> %load_ext pythran.magic
```


```python
>>> %%pythran
>>> #pythran export fma(float[:], float[:], float[:]))
>>> def fma(a, b, c):
...     return a + b * c
```


```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> n = 100000
>>> x = np.random.random(n)
>>> y = np.random.random(n)
>>> z = np.random.random(n)
```


```python
>>> %timeit fma(x, y, z)
```

    89.7 µs ± 3.27 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)


There was a bug when a cell was recompiled with the same textual content, but a new set of options. This is fixed in this version, as showcased by the following cell that compiles the same code with more agressive optimization flags, which results in faster (vectorized) code.


```python
>>> %%pythran -march=native -Ofast -DUSE_BOOST_SIMD
>>> #pythran export fma(float[:], float[:], float[:]))
>>> def fma(a, b, c):
...     return a + b * c
```


```python
>>> %timeit fma(x, y, z)
```

    74 µs ± 288 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)


# Support ``out`` param for ``np.sum``

Many ``numpy`` operation accept an ``out`` parameter, as an alternative output array to place the result of the computation. Pythran now supports this parameter for the ``numpy.sum`` and ``numpy.prod`` operations. It makes it possible to avoid an extra copy.


```python
>>> n = 1000
>>> x = np.random.random((n,n))
>>> y = np.empty(n)
```


```python
>>> %%pythran
>>> #pythran export isum(float[:, :], float[:])
>>> def isum(x, y):
...     import numpy as np
...     y[:] = np.sum(x, axis=0)
...     return y
```


```python
>>> %timeit isum(x, y)
```

    757 µs ± 11.5 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)



```python
>>> %%pythran
>>> #pythran export isum(float[:, :], float[:])
>>> def isum(x, y):
...     import numpy as np
...     np.sum(x, axis=0, out=y)
...     return y
```


```python
>>> %timeit isum(x, y)
```

    314 ns ± 0.574 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)


# Partial Constant Folding

Pythran supports (interprocedrual) constant folding since its very start, and it now also supports a degraded version that folds some operation on ``list`` and `` tuples`` when only part of the arguments is constant.


```python
>>> import gast as ast
>>> from pythran import passmanager, backend
>>> from pythran.optimizations import PartialConstantFolding
... 
>>> code = '''
>>> def replicate(n):
...     return [n] * 8
>>> '''
>>> node = ast.parse(code)
>>> pm = passmanager.PassManager("test")
>>> status, node = pm.apply(PartialConstantFolding, node)
>>> print(pm.dump(backend.Python, node))
```

    def replicate(n):
        return [n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n]


# Better Cython integration

Since version 0.8.1, and thanks to the work of [Adrien Guinet](https://twitter.com/adriengnt) funded by [OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org/), Cython has a Pythran mode to delegate Numpy expression computation to the Pythran engine. It's much more stable now, even if it does *not* mean stable :-).


```python
>>> %load_ext Cython
```

Note that the following cell calls Pythran through Cython though Jupyter magic. What a wonderful world!


```python
>>> %%cython
>>> # cython: language=c++
>>> # cython: np_pythran=True
... 
>>> import numpy as np
>>> cimport numpy as cnp
... 
>>> def tax(cnp.ndarray[double, ndim=1] d):
...     tax_seg1 = d[(d > 256303)] * 0.45 - 16164.53
...     tax_seg2 = d[(d > 54057) & (d <= 256303)] * 0.42 - 8475.44
...     seg3 = d[(d > 13769) & (d <= 54057)] - 13769
...     seg4 = d[(d > 8820) & (d <= 13769)] - 8820
...     prog_seg3 = seg3 * 0.0000022376 + 0.2397
...     prog_seg4 = seg4 * 0.0000100727 + 0.14
...     return (
...         np.sum(tax_seg1) +
...         np.sum(tax_seg2) +
...         np.sum(seg3 * prog_seg3 + 939.57) +
...         np.sum(seg4 * prog_seg4)
...     ) / np.sum(d)
```


```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> d = np.random.random(100)
```


```python
>>> %timeit tax(d)
```

    22.9 µs ± 39.4 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)



```python
>>> def tax_numpy(d):
...     tax_seg1 = d[(d > 256303)] * 0.45 - 16164.53
...     tax_seg2 = d[(d > 54057) & (d <= 256303)] * 0.42 - 8475.44
...     seg3 = d[(d > 13769) & (d <= 54057)] - 13769
...     seg4 = d[(d > 8820) & (d <= 13769)] - 8820
...     prog_seg3 = seg3 * 0.0000022376 + 0.2397
...     prog_seg4 = seg4 * 0.0000100727 + 0.14
...     return (
...         np.sum(tax_seg1) +
...         np.sum(tax_seg2) +
...         np.sum(seg3 * prog_seg3 + 939.57) +
...         np.sum(seg4 * prog_seg4)
...     ) / np.sum(d)
```


```python
>>> %timeit tax_numpy(d)
```

    28.9 µs ± 90 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)



```python
>>> abs(tax(d) - tax_numpy(d))
```
