:summary: Alias analysis is a poor term to describe the processing done by
          Pythran that is going to be described here. It could rather be named
          *static computation of identifier binding*, in the sense that it
          tries to give an over-approximation of which values an identifier can
          be bound to, at a given point of the program execution. Still,
          whatever its name, the process plays a key role in Pythran, so let's
          have a look to its internals.

Foreword
========

This is **not** a `Jupyter notebook
<http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html>`_,
but it could have been. Instead, the content of this article is mostly taken from
the `Doctest <https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html>`_ of the
``pythran.analyses.aliases`` module, and the relevant unit tests in
``test_typing.py``. So the reader still has a strong warranty that the output
described is the one she would get by running the commands herself.

The curious reader can verify this statement by running ``python -m doctest``
with Pythran in its ``PYTHONPATH`` [git-version]_ on the article source, which is in fact what
I did before posting it ``:-)``.

Static Computation of Identifier Binding
========================================

In Python, everything is a reference, from literal to objects. Assignment
creates a *binding* between a reference and an identifier, thus the following
sequence always hold:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> a = list()
    >>> b = c = a
    >>> d = b
    >>> d is a
    True

In  some sense, assignement creates aliasing between identifiers, as any change
made to the *value* referenced by the identifier ``b`` impacts the *value*
referenced by identifer ``c`` (and ``a`` and ``d``):

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> a.append(1)
    >>> len(b) == len(c) == len(d) == len(a) == 1
    True

In the context of Pythran, the static knowledge of the different values of an
identifier **may** be bound to, is critical. First there is no reason to trust
an identifier, as shown by the following code:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> id = len
    >>> id([1])
    1

Nothing prevents this to happen in Python [0]_, so Pythran takes great care in
not confusing *identifiers* and *values*. And The ill-named Alias Analysis is
the tool we use to solve this problem. In the particular case above, this
analysis tells us that the identifier ``id`` in the call expression ``id([1])``
always has the value ``__builtin__.len``. This can be used, for instance, to
state that this call has no side effect.

Where is Identifier Binding Used in Pythran
===========================================

Identifier binding is used by all Pythran analyses that interact with function
calls, when they need to know something about the function property, or when
they want to verify that all the possibles (function) values taken by an
identifier share the same property. For instance:

    #. Conversion from calls with named arguments to call without named arguments, as in ``zeros(10, dtype=int)``

    #. Conversion from iterator to generator, e.g. turning ``range`` into ``xrange`` (Python2 inside ``:-/``)

    #. Constant folding (it needs to make sure it manipulates pure functions)

    #. â€¦

But the single more important use of identifier binding is in fact, typing. This
is likely to evolve, but current (clumsy) typing system in Pythran attaches
some kind of typing properties to functions. For instance for the following
function:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> def foo(x, y): x.append(y)

Pythran computes a property that states

    > if functions ``foo`` is called with an argument of type A as first argument and an argument of type B as second argument,
    > **then** the type of the first argument is the combination of its actual type A and an abstract type *Container of B*

So in case we make the following call:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> a = b = []
    >>> foo(a, 1)

then the type of ``a`` is first computed to be *empty list* and calling ``foo``
combines this information with the fact that ``a`` must be capable of holding
integers, to conclude ``a`` has the type *list of integers*.

Identifier binding is used twice in the process. Once to prove that the
*identifier* ``foo`` is bound to the value ``foo``, and once to track which
values the *identifier* ``a`` was bound to; here to compute that the type
information gathered for ``a`` also impacts ``b``, even if ``b`` was not used
in the function call, as they share the same value.

Computing an Overset of the Bound Values
========================================

Pythran **cannot** track any possible values bound to a variable. In the following example:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> for i in range(1000):
    ...     pass

identifier ``i`` can be bound to a great deal of values, and we cannot track them individually.
Instead Pythran only keep tracks of values that are bound to an identifier. All
the others are hidden between the terms of ``<unbound-value>``.

So let's start to write some simple equations [1]_, with a few test cases demonstrated as Python code which needs some initialization:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import ast
    >>> from pythran.analyses.aliases import *
    >>> from pythran import passmanager
    >>> pm = passmanager.PassManager('demo')

Here, we basically inject the ``aliases`` namespace into current namespace for
convenience, then create an instance of the object in charge of applying passes
and gathering analysis results.

Bool Op Expression
------------------

*(A.k.a ``or`` and ``and``)*

Resulting node may alias to either operands:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a, b): return a or b')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.BoolOp)
    (a or b) => ['a', 'b']

This code snippet requires a few explanations:

    #. First, it parses a code snippet and turns it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

    #. Second, it computes the alias information at every point of the program.
           ``result`` is a dictionary that maps nodes from the AST to set of
           identifiers (remember that for Pythran, a node can only alias to
           bounded values. These values are represented by the first identifier
           they are bound to).

    #. Finally, it pretty prints the result of the analysis, using a filter to
           only dump the part we are interested in. In that case it dumps a
           textual representation of the alias set of the ``ast.BoolOp`` nodes,
           which turns out to be ``['a', 'b']``.

Unary Operator Expression
-------------------------

Resulting node does not alias to anything

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a): return -a')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.UnaryOp)
    (- a) => ['<unbound-value>']

As stated previously, values not bound to an identifier are only represented as ``<unbound-value>``.

If Expression
-------------

Resulting node alias to either branch

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a, b, c): return a if c else b')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.IfExp)
    (a if c else b) => ['a', 'b']

Dict Expression
---------------

A dict is abstracted as an unordered container of its values

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a, b): return {0: a, 1: b}')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Dict)
    {0: a, 1: b} => ['|a|', '|b|']

where the ``|id|`` notation means something that may contain ``id``.

Set Expression
--------------


A set is abstracted as an unordered container of its elements

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a, b): return {a, b}')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Set)
    {a, b} => ['|a|', '|b|']

Tuple Expression
----------------


A tuple is abstracted as an ordered container of its values

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a, b): return a, b')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Tuple)
    (a, b) => ['|[0]=a|', '|[1]=b|']

where the ``|[i]=id|`` notation means something that
may contain ``id`` at index ``i``.


Call Expression
---------------

Resulting node alias to the return_alias of called function,
if the function is already known by Pythran (i.e. it's an Intrinsic)
or if Pythran already computed it's ``return_alias`` behavior.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> fun = '''
    ... def f(a): return a
    ... def foo(b): c = f(b)'''
    >>> module = ast.parse(fun)

The ``f`` function create aliasing between
the returned value and its first argument.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Call)
    f(b) => ['b']

This also works with intrinsics, e.g. ``dict.setdefault`` which
may create alias between its third argument and the return value.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> fun = 'def foo(a, d): __builtin__.dict.setdefault(d, 0, a)'
    >>> module = ast.parse(fun)
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Call)
    __builtin__.dict.setdefault(d, 0, a) => ['<unbound-value>', 'a']

Note that complex cases can arise, when one of the formal parameter
is already known to alias to various values:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> fun = '''
    ... def f(a, b): return a and b
    ... def foo(A, B, C, D): return f(A or B, C or D)'''
    >>> module = ast.parse(fun)
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Call)
    f((A or B), (C or D)) => ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

Subscript Expression
--------------------

The resulting node alias only stores the subscript relationship if we don't know
anything about the subscripted node.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a): return a[0]')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Subscript)
    a[0] => ['a[0]']

If we know something about the container, e.g. in case of a list, we
can use this information to get more accurate informations:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a, b, c): return [a, b][c]')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Subscript)
    [a, b][c] => ['a', 'b']

Moreover, in case of a tuple indexed by a constant value, we can
further refine the aliasing information:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> fun = '''
    ... def f(a, b): return a, b
    ... def foo(a, b): return f(a, b)[0]'''
    >>> module = ast.parse(fun)
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Subscript)
    f(a, b)[0] => ['a']

Nothing is done for slices, even if the indices are known :-/

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a, b, c): return [a, b, c][1:]')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Subscript)
    [a, b, c][1:] => ['<unbound-value>']

List Comprehension
------------------

A comprehension is not abstracted in any way

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a, b): return [a for i in b]')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.ListComp)
    [a for i in b] => ['<unbound-value>']

Return Statement
----------------

A side effect of computing aliases on a Return is that it updates the
``return_alias`` field of current function

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a, b): return a')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> module.body[0].return_alias # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <function merge_return_aliases at...>

This field is a function that takes as many nodes as the function
argument count as input and returns an expression based on
these arguments if the function happens to create aliasing
between its input and output. In our case:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> f = module.body[0].return_alias
    >>> Aliases.dump(f([ast.Name('A', ast.Load()), ast.Num(1)]))
    ['A']

This also works if the relationship between input and output
is more complex:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a, b): return a or b[0]')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> f = module.body[0].return_alias
    >>> List = ast.List([ast.Name('L0', ast.Load())], ast.Load())
    >>> Aliases.dump(f([ast.Name('B', ast.Load()), List]))
    ['B', '[L0][0]']

Which actually means that when called with two arguments ``B`` and
the single-element list ``[L[0]]``, ``foo`` may returns either the
first argument, or the first element of the second argument.


Assign Statement
----------------

Assignment creates aliasing between lhs and rhs

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('def foo(a): c = a ; d = e = c ; {c, d, e}')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Set)
    {c, d, e} => ['|a|', '|a|', '|a|']

Everyone points to the formal parameter ``a`` \o/

For Statement
-------------

For loop creates aliasing between the target
and the content of the iterator

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('''
    ... def foo(a):
    ...    for i in a:
    ...        {i}''')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Set)
    {i} => ['|i|']

Not very useful, unless we know something about the iterated container

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> module = ast.parse('''
    ... def foo(a, b):
    ...     for i in [a, b]:
    ...           {i}''')
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Set)
    {i} => ['|a|', '|b|']

If Statement
------------

After an if statement, the values from both branches are merged,
potentially creating more aliasing:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> fun = '''
    ... def foo(a, b):
    ...     if a: c=a
    ...     else: c=b
    ...     return {c}'''
    >>> module = ast.parse(fun)
    >>> result = pm.gather(Aliases, module)
    >>> Aliases.dump(result, filter=ast.Set)
    {c} => ['|a|', '|b|']

Illustration: Typing
--------------------

Thanks to the above analysis, Pythran is capable of computing some rather difficult informations! In the following:

.. code-block:: python

    def typing_aliasing_and_variable_subscript_combiner(i):
        a=[list.append,
           lambda x,y: x.extend([y])
        ]
        b = []
        a[i](b, i)
        return b

Pythran knows that ``b`` is a list of elements of the same type as ``i``.

And in the following:

.. code-block:: python

    def typing_and_function_dict(a):
        funcs = {
            'zero' : lambda x: x.add(0),
            'one' : lambda x: x.add(1),
        }
        s = set()
        funcs[a](s)
        return s

Pythran knows that ``s`` is a set of integers :-)

Illustration: Dead Code Elimination
-----------------------------------

Consider the following sequence:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> fun = '''
    ... def useless0(x): return x + 1
    ... def useless1(x): return x - 1
    ... def useful(i):
    ...     funcs = useless0, useless1
    ...     funcs[i%2](i)
    ...     return i'''

Pythran can prove that both ``useless0`` and ``useless1`` don't have side
effects. Thanks to the binded value analysis, it can also prove that
**whatever** the index, ``funcs[something]`` either points to ``useless0`` or
``useless1``. And in either cases, the function has no side effect, which means
we can remove the whole instruction:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from pythran.optimizations import DeadCodeElimination
    >>> from pythran.backend import Python
    >>> module = ast.parse(fun)
    >>> _, module = pm.apply(DeadCodeElimination, module)
    >>> print pm.dump(Python, module)
    def useless0(x):
        return (x + 1)
    def useless1(x):
        return (x - 1)
    def useful(i):
        funcs = (useless0, useless1)
        pass
        return i

Other optimizations will take care of removing the useless  assignment to ``funcs`` :-)
